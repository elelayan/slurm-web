Overview
--------

Slurm-web provides both a web dashboard and a REST API to a Slurm HPC
supercomputer with views of current jobs and nodes states.

The backend REST API is developped in Python using the Flask web framework. It
is designed to run as WSGI application on a HTTP server such as Apache2. It
relies on PySLURM library to get data from Slurm workload manager. It provides
data in JSON format through a simple REST API.

The dashboard frontend is developed in HTML and Javascript, using common
de facto standard JS libraries such as jQuery and Bootstrap.
